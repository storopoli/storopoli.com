I am a software developer with a PhD and background in
Computational Statistics.
I primarily work with cryptography,
zero-knowledge protocols,
censorship-resistant tools,
and distributed systems.

If you are in a bad day, grab a curated Stoicism piece of advice at
[`stoicquotes.io`](https://stoicquotes.io).
I also made a [Sudoku App](https://sudoku.storopoli.com) that is free of spyware for my mother,
and don't need Google or Apple permissions to install (it is a PWA);
you can use it as well.

If you have state secrets or any message that you
want to pass along in the case you are incapacitated,
or dead, try my [Dead Man's Switch](https://github.com/storopoli/dead-man-switch).

Everything that I do is either open source
or has a permissive Creative Commons license.
"Open source everything".
