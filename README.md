This is my personal site at [storopoli.io](https://storopoli.io).

It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
and the theme is [WonderMod](https://github.com/Wonderfall/hugo-WonderMod) by [Wonderfall](https://github.com/Wonderfall).
WonderMod is a fork of an original theme called [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).
Since PaperMod isn't interested in a few changes such as **removing inline JavaScript**,
which I personally require to harden my websites,
I am using the WonderMod fork.
The search functionality needs JavaScript to be enabled.
However, it doesn't break the user experience if JavaScript is disabled.

Deployment is done through a [GitHub Action workflow](https://github.com/storopoli/storopoli.github.io/tree/main/.github/workflows).
It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

## JavaScript

By default, all JavaScript[^javascript] is disabled.
You can enable them in posts by setting the YAML front matter with:

```yaml
javascript: true
```

## Math Support

Math support can be enabled by setting the YAML front matter with:

```yaml
math: true
```

This will load [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) under the hood,
and anything between `$` and `$$` will be rendered as inline or equation math
using JavaScript.

Check all the supported functions in [KaTeX documentation](https://katex.org/docs/supported).

## Mermaid Support

[MermaidJS](https://mermaid.js.org/) support can be enabled by setting the YAML front matter with:

```yaml
mermaid: true
```

This will load MermaidJS under the hood,
and you can specify diagrams and charts with the shortcode:

```md
{{<mermaid>}}
flowchart LR
a --> b & c --> d
{{</mermaid>}}
```

They will be rendered automatically using JavaScript.
