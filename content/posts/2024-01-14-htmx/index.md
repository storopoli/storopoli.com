I love to learn new things and I'm passionate about Stoic philosophy.
So, when I acquired the domain
[`stoicquotes.io`](https://stoicquotes.io)^[^stoicquotes],
I've decided to give [htmx](https://htmx.org) a try.

[^stoicquotes]: you can find the source code at
[`storopoli/stoic-quotes`](https://github.com/storopoli/stoic-quotes)
