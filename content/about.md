I am a computational statistician and an ardent [Bayesian](https://youtu.be/RMNwsdb5VU4).
I like [Julia](https://julialang.org),
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/),
[Neovim](https://neovim.org/),
and [Nix](https://nixos.org).
I love math, computer science, coding, stats, and teaching.
I hate bloatware and soydevs.
My natural habitat is the terminal.
Everything that I do is either open source or has a permissive Creative Commons license.

Here's a list of some resources that I've made or contributed:

- [Julia Data Science book](https://juliadatascience.io/).
- [Graduate course on Bayesian Statistics](https://github.com/storopoli/Bayesian-Statistics)
  with [`Stan`](https://mc-stan.org) and
  [`Turing.jl`](https://turinglang.org) code examples.
- [Bayesian Statistics with Julia and `Turing.jl`](https://storopoli.io/Bayesian-Julia)
- [`TuringGLM.jl`](https://github.com/TuringLang/TuringGLM.jl)
- [Data Science and Scientific Computing with Julia (Portuguese)](https://storopoli.io/Computacao-Cientifica/)
- [Undergraduate course on Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning (Portuguese)](https://github.com/storopoli/ciencia-de-dados)
- [Why Julia? A gentle pitch](https://storopoli.io/Why-Julia)
- [Graduate course on Statistics (Portuguese)](https://storopoli.io/Estatistica/)
  with `R`
- [`Rcpp` tutorials (Portuguese)](https://storopoli.io/Rcpp/)
- [Topic Modeling workshop (Portuguese)](https://storopoli.io/topic-modeling-workshop/)

I don't have social media, since I think they are overrated
and "they sell your data".
