I am a computational statistician, data scientist, machine learning engineer;
and an ardent [Bayesian](https://youtu.be/RMNwsdb5VU4).
I like [Julia](https://julialang.org),
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/),
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/),
and [Nix](https://nixos.org).
I love math, computer science, coding, stats, and teaching.
I hate bloatware and [soydevs](../2023-11-10-2023-11-13-soydev/).
My natural habitat is the [terminal](https://github.com/storopoli/flakes).
Everything that I do is either open source or has a permissive Creative Commons license.

Here's a list of some resources that I've made or contributed:

- [Julia Data Science book](https://juliadatascience.io/).

  [online lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpTXaEnTpmwPa1lx7VCbmqsSbXb2gg2PS)
  with [`Stan`](https://mc-stan.org) and
  [`Turing.jl`](https://turinglang.org) code examples.

I don't have social media, since I think they are overrated
and "they sell your data".
